- Although the behaviors were achieved by using 1/sensor_value, no cross connections were used (right wheel always gets data from right sensor, even in case B).

- wheel_diameter parameter is not used in the twist calculation. Yes, this doesn't change the behavior for BV, but it is necessary for the job the *differential\_drive\_emulator* does: it should provide correct mapping of the wheel speeds to the robot movement.
