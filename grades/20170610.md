Feedback
========

- Overall good solution. Just a couple of details:
- When skip unreachable is not set by the execute_path_client, the server reports success instead of aborted, although the path is indeed aborted correctly. To fix this, try doing set_aborted instead of set_succeeded in line 134.
- The parameter "use_obstacle_avoidance" from the launch file is not used to decide if the path executor should ignore obstacles.
